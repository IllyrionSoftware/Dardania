To compile for BricsCAD, define the environment variable "BRX24_SDK_PATH" and set it
to the root folder where you placed the BRX SDK (for example "C:\BrxSdk").

Props: the Visual Studio projects of this sample use property sheets. These are .props files
located in build/props folder. Each file stores project settings related to a certain library,
e.g. brx24.props for BRX 24 SDK.

Build environment for applications is now VS 2019 (v142). BricsCAD and all libraries are
now compiled with VS 2019.

Check your global include folders in Visual Studio 2019 (Tools/Options/Project and
Solutions/VC++ Directories), and avoid any include folders to the SDK folders there,
as this might confuse the build configurations for BricsCAD (Debug_Bcad and Release_Bcad).

When you have defined the environment variables, you have to close and restart all 
Visual Studio 2019 instances, otherwise they will not be recognized.
